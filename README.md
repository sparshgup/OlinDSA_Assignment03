### Data Structures

The data structures implemented include `DirectedWeightedGraph`, 
`MinPriorityQueue`, and `MyMinHeap` inside `src` dir and their respective unit
tests inside `test` dir.

The `MazeSolver` is also implemented inside the `src` dir and the shortest path 
in the example mazes can be generated by running the `main()` function in `MainMazeSolver.kt`.
